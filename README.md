FlipOS

The OS that don’t play, built by Flip.

I started this project a year ago as a Python-based prototype that acted like an OS—but let’s be real, it wasn’t a real OS. Now, with FlipOS 1.7.2, I’m taking it fully off the leash: a 32-bit, from-scratch operating system, built independently with zero Linux influence. This is FlipOS energy—modular, lightweight, and made for hackers, coders, and tinkerers who want full control.

What It Does

Custom Kernel in C – fast, clean, and experimental-ready.

32-bit architecture – more power, more memory, more flex.

Modular AF – pick the features you need.

Multitasking – run multiple programs like a boss.

DIY friendly – tweak it, bend it, break it, then fix it.

Why FlipOS?

Because normal OSes are either basic or bloated. FlipOS gives you:

Freedom to hack and tinker.

Full control over the system.

A real learning playground for OS development.

Getting Started

1. Clone the repo.


2. Compile the kernel (make kernel or your build tool of choice).


3. Boot in a VM or emulator.


4. Flex your mods and tweaks.

Contribution

FlipOS is open-source. Add features, fix bugs, or just admire the code—but don’t be a dick.

Check the LICENSE file. TL;DR: Use it, mod it, share it—just keep it open and give props to Flip.
